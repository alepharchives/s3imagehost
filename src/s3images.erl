%% @todo Make this application mochiweb compatible.
%% @doc `s3images` is the core application module for the s3images project.
%% This application has 2 start phases that you should be aware of. The
%% first is the "s3" phase. During the "s3" phase the application starts
%% an s3 gen_server using the third-party s3 module. This process provides
%% the core functionality of interacting with the Amazon S3 service.
%% 
%% The second start phase is the "mnesia" whereby the application creates
%% the mnesia tables used by the application. Note that the scheme defs will
%% already have been created by this point because mnesia is a required
%% application via the s3images.app configuration file. Because of this, we
%% change the table type of the schema table to a disc_copy if it is a ram
%% copy.
